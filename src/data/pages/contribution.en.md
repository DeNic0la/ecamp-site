eCamp3 is a project that aims to re-develop the features of eCamp v2 with modern technologies and an extensible architecture. Currently, we focus on re-building just the camp planning features, which will be released in an MVP (minimal viable product). Later, extensions for course planning and other features will follow.

The following commonly requested improvements over eCamp v2 are already implemented:

- Improved saving features - where possible, data are auto-saved on the fly.
- Usability on mobile phones - the design is mobile-first.
- Login via MiData account of the Swiss Guide and Scouts Movement is possible
- Switching the user interface language, powered by [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com)
- Formatting texts (bold, italic, etc.) - is prepared, will be activated after the initial release.

eCamp v3 is made up of a backend based on the PHP framework API Platform (Symfony), which offers an API, as well as a Vue.js frontend and some other smaller services.
