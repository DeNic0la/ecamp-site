The core team is responsible for the development of eCamp v3 as well as for the operation of the server instance on this site.  

eCamp is developed entirely on a voluntary basis. New features and their implementation depend on the availability of time or on the cooperation of the community. 

We are a team of 6 computer-savvy scouts. However, cooperation is open to all youth associations or interested people.
