<FaqSection title="Questions & Answers">
    <FaqItem question="How secure is my data at eCamp?">
        In addition to the development, the core team also maintains a freely usable
        instance. The server is operated as a best-effort. For the operation of the server we use modern cloud solutions.
        This includes regular backups and server updates. Nevertheless we cannot
        guarantee uninterrupted availability.

    <FaqItem question="What will happen to eCamp v2?">
        The original eCamp version 2 can be used at
        https://ecamp.pfadiluzern.ch until further notice. However, the code is
        getting old and difficult to maintain. For a long time there has been no further
        development for eCamp v2 except for critical bug fixes. No data
        is migrated from v2 to v3.

    <FaqItem question="I have a question about eCamp v2">
        For questions/support about eCamp v2 please use the support function in
        eCamp v2 directly. No questions about eCamp v2 are answered on
        this page.

    <FaqItem question="Who is behind eCamp?">
        eCamp is developed by a [core team of volunteers](/en/team). The source code is published as
        open source. Community participation is actively encouraged.

    <FaqItem question="Can I add tasks/todos in eCamp?">
        No. We have decided not to support task lists anymore,
        as they were rarely used in the past and better alternatives are available.
        If you have used the eCamp v2 schedule list,
        you can now use the [Calendar Generator in Hering](https://scout-ch.github.io/hering/#/calendar).

    <FaqItem question="I miss the featureâ€¦">
        We will not be implementing all the features from eCamp v2 in eCamp v3 in the future.
        What we currently have planned: Special daily responsibilities, link lists to link external documents and images,
        copying blocks, and displaying block status in the overview program.
