After over 100 camps without significant issues,
we are excited to announce the end of the beta phase
and the official launch of eCamp V3.
Creating camps is no longer limited by beta coupon codes. 
We also implemented many new features since our last release.

- The optimizations in layout #2 are now available in layout #1 as well.
- Material lists can now be displayed and downloaded individually.
- The camp administration has been restructured,
  with the sections divided to provide more space for user guidance.
  The print view is now under Admin.
- Data backups are now stored in two different data centers.

Many issues, such as keyboard input for time, have been addressed based on user feedback.
We want to express our gratitude to the beta testers for their patience, feedback, and ideas.
We look forward to many new users and camps.
