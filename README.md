```

The eCamp Landingpage looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/data/pages/` and `src/data/posts/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory if they do not require any transformation or in the `assets/` directory if they are imported directly.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command        | Action                                                                     |
|:---------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `yarn`         | Installs dependencies                                                      |
| `yarn dev`     | Starts local dev server at [`localhost:3004/en`](http://localhost:3004/en) |
| `yarn build`   | Build your production site to `./dist/`                                    |
| `yarn preview` | Preview your build locally, before deploying                               |

### Deploy

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.
